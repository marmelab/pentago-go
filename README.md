# Pentago-go üçª

[Pentago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentago) game implementation in **Go**.

Definition and rules from Wikipedia:

> Pentago is a two-player abstract strategy game invented by Tomas Flod√©n. The Swedish company Mindtwister has the rights of developing and commercializing the product. The game is played on a 6√ó6 board divided into four 3√ó3 sub-boards (or quadrants). Taking turns, the two players place a marble of their color (either black or white) onto an unoccupied space on the board, and then rotate one of the sub-boards by 90 degrees either clockwise or anti-clockwise. A player wins by getting five of their marbles in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal row (either before or after the sub-board rotation in their move). If all 36 spaces on the board are occupied without a row of five being formed then the game is a draw."
